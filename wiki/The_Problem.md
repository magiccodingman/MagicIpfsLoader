# The Problem

When deploying a static web application on IPFS via a public gateway, developers often face significant challenges with reliability and performance. The core issue is that loading an entire web application through a public IPFS gateway is extremely spotty and often fails due to gateway timeouts. This can be particularly frustrating when trying to serve even small web applications, as the load failures can occur unpredictably.

### The Catch-22 Situation

To make an IPFS web application accessible, you have two primary options:

1. **Load via the Base Directory:**
   - Loading the application through the base directory ensures that the `index.html` can reference all other necessary files and directories. However, this approach frequently fails to load through public gateways unless the content has been recently cached, leading to timeouts and a poor user experience.
   - The alternative is to rely on paid services to host your files in a more performant manner. While this may resolve some performance issues, it undermines the decentralized and self-hosted nature of IPFS, which is often the primary appeal of using the platform.

2. **Directly Load the `index.html` CID:**
   - Alternatively, you can load the `index.html` directly by its CID. This method is almost guaranteed to work, as the CID ensures the content is found and loaded quickly by the gateway.
   - However, this introduces a new problem: the `index.html` file becomes isolated. It no longer has access to the base directory, meaning it cannot locate or load additional files, assets, or dependencies necessary for the application to function.

### The Challenges of Loading Only the `index.html`

Attempting to resolve the issue by focusing on directly loading the `index.html` file introduces several critical challenges:

1. **File Size Limitations:**
   - Consolidating the entire application into a single `index.html` file is not a viable solution. Modern web frameworks often require multiple files and assets, and combining everything into one file can lead to excessive file sizes, slow load times, and performance issues.

2. **Service Worker Limitations:**
   - Service workers are essential for many modern web applications, especially Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). However, when the `index.html` is loaded directly from IPFS, browsers will block the use of service workers due to cross-origin restrictions, further complicating the issue.

3. **Isolated `index.html`:**
   - When the `index.html` is loaded directly, it is effectively isolated from the rest of the application. It cannot access other necessary files, such as JavaScript, CSS, or media assets, which are crucial for the application to function properly.

### Summary

These issues create a fundamental dilemma for developers seeking to deploy web applications on IPFS. The challenge lies in finding a way to ensure reliable loading and access to all necessary files without sacrificing the decentralized and self-hosted principles that IPFS is designed to support.
